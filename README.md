## ShopFX
Simple *POS Billing Software* created using **JavaFX and CSS**. **MVC and Singleton software design patterns** were used. Along basic options/controls such as adding to cart (and checking if the entered product quantity is not larger than the product quantity in the database), emptying the cart, removing selected items, I've implemented an *autocomplete TextField* (not case-sensitive) that suggests products based on the entered name prefix. It is possible to remove product entirely from the database in the app (when it happens, it will also be deleted from the cart if it was previously there). SceneBuilder was **NOT** used.
