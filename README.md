## ShopFX
Simple *POS Billing Software* created using **JavaFX and CSS**. In addition, used an **MVC and Singleton software design patterns**. Along basic options/controls such as emptying the cart, removing selected items, I've implemented an *autocomplete TextField* (not case-sensitive) that suggests products based on the entered name prefix. It is possible to remove product entirely from the database in the app (when it happens, it will also be deleted from the cart if it was previously there). SceneBuilder was **NOT** used.
